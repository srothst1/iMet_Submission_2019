"The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, also known as The Met, has a diverse collection of 
over 1.5M objects of which over 200K have been digitized with imagery. The online cataloguing 
information is generated by Subject Matter Experts (SME) and includes a wide range of data. These 
include, but are not limited to: multiple object classifications, artist, title, period, date, medium,
culture, size, provenance, geographic location, and other related museum objects within The Met’s 
collection. While the SME-generated annotations describe the object from an art history perspective,
they can also be indirect in describing finer-grained attributes from the museum-goer’s understanding. 
Adding fine-grained attributes to aid in the visual understanding of the museum objects will enable the
ability to search for visually related objects."
